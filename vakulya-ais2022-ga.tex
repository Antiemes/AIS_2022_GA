\section{Introduction}

Genetic algirithms (GA) \cite{ga-book} offer good
approximations to various
problems, where no fast algorithm is known to calculate
the optimal solutions. It models the natural selection,
where each member of a population (called specimen)
represents one possible solution.

GA starts with an initial population, which is a set of
possible solutions (e.g. empty or randomly generated).
In each cycle GA produces new specimens by applying
\emph{mutation} and \emph{crossover} operations on the
existing ones. Then the population is evaluated by
the \emph{selection} operator based on the \emph{fitness}
function.

In this paper a GA-based lossy image compression method is
presented. A number of triangles are used to approximate
a monochromatic image; the position of the triangles are
optimized with GA. The chromosome representation, the
mutation and crossover operators and different selection
strategies are evaluated. The algorithm is capable to give
recognizable approximation of images in the 100 byte range,
which means an extreme compression in exchange for the
lower quality output.

\section{Related work}

Genetic algorithms are suitable to problems, where
there is no efficient solution available to calculate
the optimal (or, in many cases, any) solution.
An advantage of GA is the iterative operation, making it possible
to stop the optimization process in any time and use the current
best solution.

Scheduling is an everyday problem in industy \cite{ga-scheduling}
and transportation planning \cite{ga-transport}, where genetic
algorithms can offer a good alternative to e.g. linear programming.

A similar area covers the Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP).
A practical genetic algorithm based solution can be found in \cite{ga-vrp}.
It is closely related to the traveling salesman problem, which
can also be approximated with GA \cite{ga-tsp}.

A good application of genetic algorithm is calculating
the synaptic weights of neural networks. MarIO \cite{mar-io}
is an AI player to the Super Mario game.

Genetic algorithms are also suitable to generate program code
(genetic programming) to determine the behavior of e.g.
autonomous robots. A good example is \cite{ga-robocode},
where a specially tailored programming language (Robocode)
is used to program virtual battle robots.

In economics portfolio optimization \cite{ga-portfolio}
and automatic trading \cite{ga-trading}
can be implemented with genetic algorithms.

In the area of image processing GA can be
efficiently used in combination with neural networks for e.g.
image segmentation \cite{ga-imgseg} or image enhancement \cite{ga-imgenh}.
Image compression tends to use fast algorithms to give an
indentical (lossless compression) or an indistinguishable
(lossy compression) representation of the input image,
in significantly less space \cite{image-proc}.

\section{The GA-based image compression}

\subsection{Problem statement}

An image $IMG$ is given as square ($n \times n$) matrix, where each pixel is
either black or white:

\begin{equation}
	IMG = (a_{ij}) \in {0,1}^{n \times n}
\end{equation}

An approximation is given as a set of $n$ triangles. The vertices of
the triangles are placed in the target image, in integer positions,
and can have either black or white color. The $k^\text{th}$ triangle
$t_k$ can be given as a quad:

\begin{equation}
	t_k = (A, B, C, c), A, B, C \in {1 \dots n}^2, c \in {0, 1}
\end{equation}

Time $I(t_k)$ image of triangle $t_k$ is a set of points, which are geometrically
between the vertices:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	I(t_k) &= {a_{ij}},\\
	\exists \alpha, \beta &\in [0, 1]:\\
	i &= \beta(\alpha A_1 + (1-\alpha)B_1)+(1-\beta)C_1\\
	j &= \beta(\alpha A_2 + (1-\alpha)B_2)+(1-\beta)C_2
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Chromosome representation}

The chromosome representation of an approximation $Q$ is
a set of triangles, represented by a triplet $(k, T, C)$, where

\begin{itemize}

	\item{$k \in Z$ is the number of triangles used in the approximation,}

	\item{$T \in Z^{k \times 3 \times 2}$ is the set of triangles,
	given with 3 coordinate pairs,}

	\item{$C \in {0,1}^k$ is the set of triangle colors.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fitness function}

The image form $R$ of an approximation $(k, T, C)$ is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
	R_{i,j}(k, T, C)=
	\begin{cases}
		C_v,& \exists v: (i, j) \in I(T_v),\\
		    & \nexists w: w>v, (i, j) \in I(T_v),\\
				&1 \leq v, w \leq k\\
		0,  & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Instead of the fitness function, where the more suitable
specimen have larger fitness, an $E$ error function is used, representing
the proportion of the mismatching area between the target image and the triangle
based approximation, as a percentage.

\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
		E = \frac{\sum_{i,j} \left( \frac{IMG_{i,j}-R_{i,j}}{mn} \right)}{n^2}\cdot 100\\
		1 \leq i,j \leq n
	\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Genetic operators}

The three genetic operators (mutation, crossover and selection)
are implemented as follows. Three simple mutation types was
built into the program.

\begin{itemize}

	\item{\emph{M1} removes a randomly selected triangle}

	\item{\emph{M2} adds a triangle with random coordinates}

	\item{\emph{M3} modifies the position of 1, 2 or 3 vertices of a triangle}

\end{itemize}

The crossover operator takes triangles from two selected triangle-set
and takes triangles from both, randomly.

During the selection the fitness function is calculated and a defined
amount of the population is eliminated and overwritten by
newly generated specimen (by crossover).

\subsection{Program flow}

The flow of the program goes through the following steps.

Step 1. Loading the reference image.

Step 2. Generating the initial population, where each specimen
consist of one randomly generated triangle.

Step 3. Applying \emph{mutation} operators for each specimen
with predefined probabilities.

Step 4. Calculating the \emph{error} for each specimen.

Step 5. Writing out statistical information.

Step 6. Applying the \emph{selection} operator, i.e.
eliminating the specimen with the highest error.

Step 7. Generating new specimen with \emph{crossover}
in place of the eliminated ones.

Step 8. Repeating the procedure from Step 3 until achieving
the desired number of generations.

\subsection{Software architecture}

The image approximation algorithm is implemented in C,
without using external libraries (besides glibc). This
approach makes the code easily portable, but on the other
hand it makes handling of different image formats more
difficult. Thus, only loading and saving of BMP files
with predefined resolution and color depth are supported.

The test program prints a short information line after
each generation, which contains the generation number,
the error of the best matching approximation and the
current number of polygons. The best matching image is
saved after each generation, to give more visual feedback.

With the actual settings each approximated image takes

\begin{itemize}

\item{8 bits to store the number of polygons,}

\item{$3 \times 2 \times 9 \times k$ bits to store the triangle
coordinates,}

\item{and $k$ bits to store the colors of the triangles,}

\end{itemize}

sum up to $1+\frac{55}{8}k$ bytes.

\section{Test results}

To test the performance of the proposed image approximation
method, two moderately complex test images was selected,
as shown in Fig. \ref{fig-orig}. Both images have a
resolution of $512 \times 512$ pixels.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{fig/originals.png}
	\caption{The selected test images.
	(a) Silhouette of Sherlock Holmes,
	(b) Silhouette of a cat.}
	\label{fig-orig}
\end{figure}

The approximation algorithm was tested with the selected
images with the following settings. The size of the population
is 2048. In each generation each specimen is mutated with the
\emph{M1}, \emph{M2} and \emph{M3} operators with 10\%, 50\%
and 80\% probability, respectively. The 1800 worst specimen
was overwritten with the crossover of randomly selected ones.
Note that this is an elitist setup, which can lead to a fast
convergence, at a risk of a less accurate final result.

The polygon limit was set to $k_{max}=5$, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50,
60, 70 and 80. Each different setup was run through 1000 generations.

Figures \ref{sherlock-6} and \ref{cat-6} show the image with
the best fitness after 25, 50, 100, 200, 300 and 500 generations
with $k_{max}=20$ polygons. As can be clearly seen, the
accuracy of the approximation quickly increases first; both
images are recognizable after 200 generations, but only slight
improvements can be observed afterwards.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{fig/sherlock6.png}
	\caption{The best matching Sherlock image after $g$ generations.}
	\label{sherlock-6}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{fig/cat6.png}
	\caption{The best matching cat image after $g$ generations.}
	\label{cat-6}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{curve-sherlock} and \ref{curve-cat} show the change
of best observed fitness after each generation for the Sherlock
and the cat images. Different colors mean different maximal
triangle numbers. With extremely low polygon count the approximation
remains very rough. Adding more than approx\@. 30 triangles
does not make any quantitative improvement, some extra detail
was observed up to 60 triangles. A recognizable image approximated
with 20 triangles takes 139 bytes of data.

\section{Comparison to compression algorithms}

Images can be compressed with (lossless and lossy) image
compression algorithms and with general data compression
software as well. To provide a comparison in term of
size the test images were compressed with the two most
well-known image compression methods (PNG and JPEG)
and two general data compression solutions (rar and bzip2).

The compression level of PNG was set to the highest
value and JPEG is tuned to worst quality (smallest file
size) setting. Storing of extra data (i.e. EXIF, colorspace
information) was turned off for both formats. Rar was used with
\texttt{-m5 -md4096} settings, and the \texttt{-9} switch
was used with bzip2. Both settings means the best possible
compression. The proposed approximation algorithm was
used with $k_{max}=20$ and $k_{max}=50$. The results are
summarized in Table \ref{compression}.

\section{Summary}

A genetic algorithm based image approximation method
was proposed. The algorithm can approximate black and
white images with a limited (definable) number of
black and white triangles. The GA is implemented
with 3 mutation and a crossover operator. Selection
operator uses an elitist approach. Formal definition
was given to the fitness function computation.

The proposed algorithm was implemented as a C
language program and tested with different input
images and with several maximal number of triangles.

The algorithm can generate a recognizable quality
approximation of images with moderate complexity
in less than 150 bytes with computation time
under 10 miutes.
